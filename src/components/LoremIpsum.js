          My name is Colin FitzGerald.

          My story started with running. Ever since I was a little kid, I loved to run. 
          I brought intense passion and dedication to the sport I loved so dearly, and I was lucky enough 
          to have it translate into acceptance into virtually any university of my choice.

          I chose to attend the University of California, Berkeley, where I am currently a student-athlete.

          My major is Economics while my minor is in Data Science.

          During quarantine, I decided to learn to code since I didn’t have any prior experience.

          I was awful at first. I struggled and couldn’t grasp even the most basic concepts. However, I was persistent and patient with myself.

          Slowly, I am becoming more confident in my ability to code. I find it interesting; to me, it’s one huge puzzle.

          I started small with simple Python projects and dabbled a little bit in R.
          </p>
          <p>
          As I have continued through the years, I find myself enjoying coding more and more. One day, I hope to contribute to projects that can change the world. Until then, I’m working hard to learn as much as I can.
          </p>
          <p>
          My time in coding is split between Website projects and Data Science.
